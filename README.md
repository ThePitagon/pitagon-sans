## About

Pitagon Sans is a fresh take on geometric sans serif styles, contains the Pitagon Design Principles embodied in the
Pitagon Design System (Pi Design System). Pitagon Sans is implemented and inspired by open source font sets like as
Quicksand, Maven Pro. The font set is used in the context of specific use of big text such as title, heading, etc.

Taking inspiration in Maven Pro with unique curvature and flowing rhythm, the font set is very distinguishable and
legible when in context. It blends styles of many great typefaces and is suitable for any design medium. The font set
also conveys well the brand message of Pitagon is "<b><i>BREAKTHROUGH</i></b> the limits".

The font set are made available for public use under the SIL Open Font License.
